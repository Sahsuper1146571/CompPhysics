The first part of section 3 follow the same step in  two body for jupiter orbit. 
some genral idea is added below. If the two body was section was done differently, please indicate some changes that might be added to  
for the jupiter orbit. 
from scipy.integrate import odeint 
import numpy as np
m scale to 1 for sun 
M = 1 
eccentricity = 0.048775 = e 
e = Rmax(alphelion) - Rmin(pheripelion)/ Rmax + rmin
def (x, y)
x = GMX/(X^2+y^2)^3/2 
y = GMY/Y^2+x^2)^3/2
alphelion for jupiter in y axis = 4.950429  
coordinate = (0, 495049)

r in term of planetary orbit in kepler 
r = r0/ 1 - ecos(angle) 
r = alphelion 
r0 = semi major axis
